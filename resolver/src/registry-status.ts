/**
 * @file registry-status.ts
 *
 * Resolver-side operational policy for registration, stake maintenance, and
 * slash consequences (see docs/operational-policy.md).
 *
 * The on-chain ResolverRegistry contracts do NOT expose a single "lifecycle"
 * enum — each chain derives status from a handful of primitive fields, and
 * the two chains diverge:
 *
 *   EVM      (contracts/contracts/ResolverRegistry.sol):
 *              { stake, registeredAt, lastSlashAt, totalSlashed, active }
 *              `active` auto-reactivates on `increaseStake()` once
 *              stake >= minStake again. No unbonding window — `unregister()`
 *              deletes the record immediately.
 *
 *   Soroban  (soroban/contracts/resolver-registry/src/lib.rs):
 *              { stake, registered_at, last_slash_at, total_slashed, active,
 *                unbonding_at: Option<u64> }
 *              `active` does NOT auto-reactivate on `increase_stake()` — a
 *              slashed-below-minimum resolver must fully exit
 *              (`request_unregister` -> wait out the unbonding window ->
 *              `withdraw_stake`) and re-`register()`. `unbonding_at` is set
 *              the moment `request_unregister()` is called and stays set
 *              until `withdraw_stake()` succeeds.
 *
 * `deriveLifecycleState()` below is this module's chain-agnostic contract:
 * it maps either chain's raw fields onto one shared, testable state machine
 * so the rest of the resolver (metrics, health checks, logs) never has to
 * know which chain it's looking at.

/**
 * The resolver's own logical standing with a chain's ResolverRegistry, as

 *
 *  - unregistered : no on-chain record for this address (never registered,
 *                    or a Soroban unbonding completed and stake was withdrawn).
 *  - active        : registered, sufficiently staked, eligible to fill orders.
 *  - low_stake     : stake has fallen below the current minimum for a reason
 *                    OTHER than a slash (e.g. the admin raised minStake).
 *  - slashed       : stake is below the current minimum AND this resolver has
 *                    a nonzero slash history — under-collateralized because of
 *                    a penalty, not an admin parameter change.
 *  - unbonding     : (Soroban only) `request_unregister()` has been called;
 *                    stake is locked until the unbonding window elapses and
 *                    `withdraw_stake()` is called.
 *  - inactive      : registered, sufficiently staked, but the contract's
 *                    `active` flag is false. Should not normally be reachable
 *                    on either chain today, but is kept as an explicit,
 *                    non-throwing fallback rather than silently misreporting
 *                    "active" if a future contract change introduces a new
 *                    way to flip the flag without changing stake.
